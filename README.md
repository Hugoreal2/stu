# stu

A Go-based template engine inspired by Jinja, a popular templating engine used in Python web frameworks. This project aims to provide similar templating capabilities using Go's standard and extended templating features.
Features

Familiar Syntax: Use Jinja-like syntax with {{ }} for variables and {% %} for control structures.
Custom Filters and Functions: Extend the engine with custom filters and functions to suit specific needs.
Block-based Inheritance: Use block inheritance to build reusable templates.
Conditionals and Loops: Support for common control structures like if-statements and loops.
